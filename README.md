Mercury Package
===============================
The Original Mercury package version created by John E. Chambers
-------------------------------------------------

This repository contains the original ``MERCURY 6.2`` FORTRAN77 code from John E. Chambers available originally at [http://www.arm.ac.uk/~jec/home.html](http://www.arm.ac.uk/~jec/home.html)

Mercury is a general-purpose N-body integration package for problems in celestial mechanics. It is the N-body integrator based on Bulirsh-Stoer, Everhart and other methods. It can "out of box" integrate every system like Solar System, 3 body problem and so on. The configuration is really simple. Current package is preconfigured for Linux and Mac OS X users with compile and clean tasks.

Overview
--------

These are the files necessary to compile and run the Mercury N-body integrator package, version 6.2.

The following files should be present:

- big.in
- close.in
- close6.for
- element.in
- element6.for
- files.in
- mercury.inc
- mercury6.man
- mercury6_2.for
- message.in
- param.in
- small.in
- swift.inc

Start by looking at the manual contained in mercury6.man

- mercury6_2.for contains the source code for the integrator.
- element6.for contains source code for a programme to turn compressed output from mercury into coordinates or orbital elements for each object.
- close6.for contains source code for a programme to provide details on close encounters during an integration.

Running Mercury
-----

Remove ``*.out``, ``*.dmp`` and ``*.tmp`` files from older runs before running. Remember to compile the code before each run, using ```gfortran mercury6_2.for -o mercury6``` for example. Then run ```mercury6```, ```element6```, and ```close6``` optionally.

Or use the ``Makefile:``

To compile on Linux or Mac OS X just run ``make`` on the terminal at current directory. You need to have gfortran compiler. If you don't have you need to install it. For other compilers change the corresponding lines in ``Makefile``. This file can be changed if you want to use another compiler as the default one (gfortran). Usually I use the compiler ifort, which leads to faster integration time.

To clean the directory *.o files run ``make clean``.
